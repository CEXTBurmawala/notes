## Working with GitHub

- Create a new branch when starting a project.
- Once features are implemented, push branch to GitHub and make a pull request.
- Branch will be merged into 'develop' branch.
- Once all work is completed, the 'develop' branch will be merged into the 'master' branch for moving into UAT and/or production (prod).
