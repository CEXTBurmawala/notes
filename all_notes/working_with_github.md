## Working with GitHub

### General
- Create a new branch when starting a project.
- Once features are implemented, push branch to GitHub and make a pull request.
- Branch will be merged into 'develop' branch.
- Once all work is completed, the 'develop' branch will be merged into the 'master' branch for moving into UAT and/or production (prod).

### Editing Pull Requests
If changes are required in a pull request, here are the following steps to follow:
- Make the changes, commit changes and push changes to the branch. The pull request will be updated with the new changes and someone can review the PR again.

If others make changes, follow the same steps but you need to pull the recent commits pushed by other before making further changes.
