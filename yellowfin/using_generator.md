## Using Yellowfin Generator

1. In order to set up yellowfin with the help of the generator, start by following this guide for exporting a base view of the app: [Yellowfin docs](https://github.com/i-Sight/isight-self-service/blob/master/docs/yellowfin.md)

- delete the master view from the Browse Views
- delete the data source from Admin console > data Sources

2. Using the online portal [here](https://autobot.i-sight.com) generate the files for the app.

3. Log back into the app and import the files (as per the guide in step 1).

4. Finish all the steps in the Yellowfin Setup Guide after the Views section.
