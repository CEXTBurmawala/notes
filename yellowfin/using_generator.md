## Using Yellowfin Generator

1. In order to set up yellowfin with the help of the generator, start by following this guide for exporting a base view of the app: [Yellowfin docs](https://github.com/i-Sight/isight-self-service/blob/master/docs/yellowfin.md)

- start building the yellowfin system based on the guide, following the steps until the 'views' section
- once done:
	- delete the master view from the Browse Views
	- delete the data source from Admin console > data Sources

2. Using the online portal [here](https://autobot.i-sight.com) generate the files for the app.

3. Back into yellowfin and import the files (as per the guide in step 1). Only import the "<app> Master View" and "<app> Prod" with the database logo on it.

4. Finish all the steps in the Yellowfin Setup Guide after the Views section.
