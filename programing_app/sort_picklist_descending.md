To sort picklist items in descending order instead of ascending order, a filter function needs to be created in the config directory and a reference needs to be made to the filter function in the `config/options.picklists` file for the specific picklist.

[Here](https://github.com/i-Sight/config_mnsu_v5/commit/6523819a7fb95fdb1b019c460e3863ac964745c9) is the commit showing the code.
