## Suggested Links

In order to add suggested links between entities, a `relationship-field-mappings.js` file needs to be created in the entity folder that
requires the links (case / party).

- Look in old projects and in platform for examples of link relationships and how they are written.
- ensure to require the relationship file inside the `index.js` file.
