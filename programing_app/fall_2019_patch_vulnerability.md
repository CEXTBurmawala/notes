## Fall 2019 Vulnerability Path

The vulnerability patch needs to be applied to 4.x apps. The patches are contained in PRs on the pro base (`https://github.com/i-Sight/config_pro_base_v5`).

- Check if pro base is added as remote repo, run `git remote -v`
- Setup pro base as 'base', run `git remote add base git@github.com:i-Sight/config_pro_base_v5`
- Run `git fetch base`
- Run the following commands to add the patches:
	```shell
	git cherry-pick b13b0e4
	git cherry-pick 9bd4b5b
	git cherry-pick d632bf4
	```
- Run `git log` to verify that the changes have been committed.
- Update the 'department' field in `entities/users/acl.js` file (line ~63, where the filter has the role 'edit_users') with the default field. The default field can be found in `entities/users/index.js`
- Push the changes to GitHub and double check that the PRs have been applied.
