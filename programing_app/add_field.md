## Add Field Type

In order to add a field to case/party/entity, follow the steps below. If the field adds a picklist, see the notes [HERE](./change_field_type.md) to add the picklists to the app.

### [5.x app]
In the 5.x app, the script `make auto-migrate` takes care of adding fields (as long as they are not new picklists fields).
