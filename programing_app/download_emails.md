## Download emails & attachments

This feature adds a download button in the Activity tab of a selected case. The feature converts all 
the selected emails to PSF and collects all related attachments and combines them into folders for 
each thread, and zips all the content in a folder which the customer can download.

See [here](https://github.com/i-Sight/config_uhhospitals_v5/pull/53/files) for example code to add 
this feature.
