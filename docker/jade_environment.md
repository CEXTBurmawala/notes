## Using JADE Containerized Development Environment

Apps can be built and worked on locally inside a containerized development environment. The steps below outline the requirements to get up and running.

Note, docker containers should be stopped if using JADE

#### [1] Installing JADE
- first step is to make sure you are using a font in your terminal that is compatible with powerline. The best thing to do is to create a separate profile in iTerm2 for JADE and setting the font to "Ubuntu Mono derivative Powerline".
- clone the JADE repo to your home directory
- navigate into the directory and run the install script `./extern/mac/provision`
